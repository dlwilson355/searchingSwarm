# serachingSwarm
My project for evolutionary robotics in which a swarm of robots explores the environment with the intention of knocking over as many objects in the environment as possible within a given time frame.

Running geneticAlgorithm.py will evovle robots with whatever constants are set in constants.py.

Running runTests.py will run the tests specified in the program and save the resulting fitness scores and genomes from each test.

A video of this project is available at: https://youtu.be/BvPoM70VH4w.
